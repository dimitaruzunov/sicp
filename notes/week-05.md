"Week" 5 (2017-09-19 â€“ 2017-10-08)
==================================

We decided to set a new milestone and complete 2.3.1 for the next meeting.
Other than that, we discussed:

* Many of the exercises do not provide much insight, despite taking
much time to complete
* We have become very reliant on computers to verify the correctness of
the programs that we write, even the simple ones
* The equivalence between Turing machines and the lambda calculus
* Examples of practical applications of functional programming languages
* We should maybe consider alternatives to Slack (because of the message limit)
