Week 1 (2017-07-18 – 2017-07-25)
================================

Notes on our first study group meeting
--------------------------------------
We've set our target for the next week – to complete Chapter 1.
We've discussed that we don't have to stick with Scheme for solving the
exercises. Georgi and Evgeni will use Clojure, Plamen and Rado will use
Haskell, Ianis and Zdravko will use Racket and
Toni and I will stick with Scheme.

Resources
---------
Here are some resources that can help while going through the book:
* [SICP book official page](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp)
* [SICP book in fancy HTML and EPUB formats](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp)
* [SICP book in PDF format](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf)
* [SICP Distilled](http://www.sicpdistilled.com) – SICP with Clojure
* [SICP MIT video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures)

Questions
---------
* Is my assumption about normal-order evaluation in exercise 1.6 correct?

Remarks
-------
While I was reading Chapter 1, I noticed some references to computability
theory topics such as effectiveness – the ability to compute a function
using an algorithm, and declarative ("what-is") knowledge vs. imperative
("how-to") knowledge.
