"Week" 4 (2017-08-08 â€“ 2017-09-19)
==================================

Since we haven't had a meeting for over a month, we decided to hold a small one.
We only discussed some general topics:

* The amount of content that can be fit into a book section without sacrificing
readability and understandability
* How the SICP book's most difficult exercises seem to provide little insight
about something that is useful outside of the concrete exercise or section
* The difference between implementing a language compiler/interpreter that uses
hardware registers and one that uses emulated software registers
